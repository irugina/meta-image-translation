# meta-image-translation

Repository for few-shot image translation applications, in particular SEVIR but also miniimagenet for fast prototyping. 
Dataloaders are borrowed from [here](https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix) and the UNet model architecture from [here](https://github.com/milesial/Pytorch-UNet).
